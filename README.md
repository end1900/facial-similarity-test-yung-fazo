## About

Greetings!  
This app captures what it means to truly be Guyanese — to see if you look like Yung Fazo.  
Haha, just kidding… but if you didn’t know, Guyana has one of the world’s largest diasporas by percentage of its native-born population living abroad — around 36% or more (Forbes.com, 2022).  

So, as you can imagine, many people around the world might look somewhat similar to Yung Fazo, right..?
